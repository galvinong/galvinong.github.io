A starting point for what this blog will introduce. This blog was created to explore the ideas/concepts of items related to tech; such as computer parts, networking systems and day to day items.

### Why?
This blog was made to test out how easy it was to host a blog on github pages using jekyll which utilizes liquid templating engine, with simple directory formatting and markdown for posts. I was able to get this up within minutes.

Powered by
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* [Jedkyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde#usage)

Other options of hosting were thought of, examples such as 

1. Using my own NAS/server to host a site, using either apache/nginx to serve
    * Have to manage everything from acquiring a domain name to managing LB/HA, possibility of getting DDoS on your own personal internet connection as well which isn't a great idea.
    * Advantage of choosing your own tech stack 
2. Renting a virtualized linux container such as linode/AWS/Heroku/Azure
    * The more expensive option, these options often come with bandwidth/CPU limits.
    * Same benefits such as tech stack and hosted options often comes with optimized routes.

Hopefully this will give some form of concept towards people who were thinking of creating one.

### Videos
As a start, I would like to just put down a few youtubers who help people discover more about computer hardware. Some might be a bit too technical while some is great for general knowledge about upcoming tech.
